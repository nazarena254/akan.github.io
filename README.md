With ( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7</br>
One can get the day of week in which they were born</br>
Given that the invalid day of birth is DD<=0 or DD>31</br>
Given that the invalid month of birth is MM<=0 or MM>12</br>
Given that the invalid year of birth is has no century digit(CC) eg 19,20 and year digit(YY) eg 00,12</br>
And the I enter the correct birth day, month and year</br>
When I click on the Find Akan Name button</br>
Then I should see an alert on my Akan name</br>
Otherwise I should see an alert on invalid DD or MM or CCYY</br>
